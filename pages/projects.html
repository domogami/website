									<p>
										IEEE Quarterly Projects are your path to a great project experience. With more time 
										than a hackathon, but without the commitment of an annual project, build a project 
										over the quarter that you are proud of while joining a team of 3 or even forming your
										own team with 2 other friends! *Quarterly Projects is multi-disciplinary* and is 
										inclusive to all interested in engineering, so anyone is welcome and encouraged to apply! </br> </br>
											
										Once accepted IEEE Quarterly Projects you have access to *mentors and workshops* such
										that you have the opportunities to create the best project you can, and of course 
										supplement you resume by demonstrating to others your ability and drive to create 
										projects outside of the classroom. Building a project in Quarterly Projects is one 
										of the best ways to get the hard skills AND soft skills that you need to get hired
										and build further relationships in college! </br>
											
										APPLY ASAP to get the best chances of acceptance!

									<h2 class="major">Annual Projects</h2>
									<p>
										Every year, IEEE at UC San Diego sponsors teams to participate in building the project 
										and attending competitions. Applicants are put in teams and go through the process of designing, 
										fabricating, testing and competing with their project. Along the way, participants will learn 
										collaboration and research skills that come with team-based projects while being able to apply
										their academic knowledge in a competitive environment. </br> </br>

										At the end of the project, the team has access to their team website and live demos of their robot, 
										allowing them to show off their work to impress both recruiters and friends. Applications for annual 
										projects open at the beginning of every fall quarter! </br> </br>

										Check out some of the annual projects we have below!

												<h2 class="major">GrandPRIEEE: Autonomous Line-Following Vehicle Robotics Project</h2>
												<p>
													The Grand PrIEEE competition (formerly Viacar) involves following a track consisting 
													of a wire carrying a 100mA rms 75kHz sinusoidal signal taped to the floor. Both the 
													wire and the white tape provide opportunities to track the course, typically via either 
													induction or computer vision. Given that the typical hobbyist remote control car today 
													can achieve significant speed, this makes the ability to optimize a tracking algorithm 
													critical to success.
												</p>
												<h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
												<p>
													PID Control, Algorithm Development, Computer Vision, Mechanical Design

												<p>
													The California Micromouse competition (CAMM) has been around since its 
													introduction by IEEE in 1977. Our competition today features a 16x16 
													grid maze and much fiercer competition, as technology has come a long way! 
												</p>
												<h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
												<p>
													EagleCAD, digital signal processing, surface mount soldering, programming 
													microcontrollers, embedded programming for ARM processors and ICâ€™s, PID control,
													and implementing flood fill algorithms.

												<h2 class="major">Project Drive: Fully Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Race Car</h2>
												<p>
													Each year, project drive team builds a compact autonomous vehicle that can navigate 
													through various outdoor terrains and compete at the competition. Project Drive is 
													an advanced project that requires students with previous experience to write a research 
													paper in addition to using integrated robotics systems, machine vision, and navigation/localization 
													methods to design the vehicle. This project serves as a learning experience for members to become 
													familiar with team functionality, research, and robotics systems.
												</p>
												<h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
												<p>
													CAD design, signal processing with sensors, control theory with both PID and 
													localization/navigation methods, and computer vision.

												<p>
													We are building multiple autonomous drones to compete in the 2019 International 
													Aerial Robotics Competition. The overall goal of the competition is to navigate 
													an obstacle course, using the drones to perform various tasks. The drones will 
													be controlled with both voice commands and hand gestures. For this project, the 
													team will also be required to provide a research paper that encompasses their work 
													throughout the project in a professional manner, which will be published and presented 
													at the competition.
