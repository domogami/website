    <h2 class="major">Quarterly Projects</h2>
    <p>
      IEEE Quarterly Projects are your path to a great project experience. With more time 
      than a hackathon, but without the commitment of an annual project, build a project 
      over the quarter that you are proud of while joining a team of 3 or even forming your
      own team with 2 other friends! *Quarterly Projects is multi-disciplinary* and is 
      inclusive to all interested in engineering, so anyone is welcome and encouraged to apply! </br> </br>
        
      Once accepted IEEE Quarterly Projects you have access to *mentors and workshops* such
      that you have the opportunities to create the best project you can, and of course 
      supplement you resume by demonstrating to others your ability and drive to create 
      projects outside of the classroom. Building a project in Quarterly Projects is one 
      of the best ways to get the hard skills AND soft skills that you need to get hired
      and build further relationships in college! </br>
        
      APPLY ASAP to get the best chances of acceptance!

  <div id="Annual" class ="inner">
    <h2 class="major">Annual Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Every year, IEEE at UC San Diego sponsors teams to participate in building the project 
      and attending competitions. Applicants are put in teams and go through the process of designing, 
      fabricating, testing and competing with their project. Along the way, participants will learn 
      collaboration and research skills that come with team-based projects while being able to apply
      their academic knowledge in a competitive environment. </br> </br>

      At the end of the project, the team has access to their team website and live demos of their robot, 
      allowing them to show off their work to impress both recruiters and friends. Applications for annual 
      projects open at the beginning of every fall quarter! </br> </br>

      Check out some of the annual projects we have below!

      <div id="GrandPRIEEE" class="inner">
        <h3 class="major">GrandPRIEEE: Autonomous Line-Following Vehicle Robotics Project</h3>	
        <p>
          The Grand PrIEEE competition (formerly Viacar) involves following a track consisting 
          of a wire carrying a 100mA rms 75kHz sinusoidal signal taped to the floor. Both the 
          wire and the white tape provide opportunities to track the course, typically via either 
          induction or computer vision. Given that the typical hobbyist remote control car today 
          can achieve significant speed, this makes the ability to optimize a tracking algorithm 
          critical to success.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
        <p>
          PID Control, Algorithm Development, Computer Vision, Mechanical Design

      <div id="Micromouse" class="inner">
        <h3 class="major">Micromouse: Autonomous Maze Solving Robotics Project</h3>
        <p>
          The California Micromouse competition (CAMM) has been around since its 
          introduction by IEEE in 1977. Our competition today features a 16x16 
          grid maze and much fiercer competition, as technology has come a long way! 
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
        <p>
          EagleCAD, digital signal processing, surface mount soldering, programming 
          microcontrollers, embedded programming for ARM processors and ICâ€™s, PID control,
          and implementing flood fill algorithms.

      <div id="Project Drive" class="inner">
        <h3 class="major">Project Drive: Fully Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Race Car</h3>
        <p>
          Each year, project drive team builds a compact autonomous vehicle that can navigate 
          through various outdoor terrains and compete at the competition. Project Drive is 
          an advanced project that requires students with previous experience to write a research 
          paper in addition to using integrated robotics systems, machine vision, and navigation/localization 
          methods to design the vehicle. This project serves as a learning experience for members to become 
          familiar with team functionality, research, and robotics systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Highlights:</h3>
        <p>
          CAD design, signal processing with sensors, control theory with both PID and 
          localization/navigation methods, and computer vision.
        </p>

      <div id="Quadcopter" class="inner">
        <h3 class="major">Quadcopter: Autonomous UAV Project</h3>
        <p>
          We are building multiple autonomous drones to compete in the 2019 International 
          Aerial Robotics Competition. The overall goal of the competition is to navigate 
          an obstacle course, using the drones to perform various tasks. The drones will 
          be controlled with both voice commands and hand gestures. For this project, the 
          team will also be required to provide a research paper that encompasses their work 
          throughout the project in a professional manner, which will be published and presented 
          at the competition. 
        </p>
